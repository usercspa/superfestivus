# superfestivus
The concept of Festivus is unique but sadly not many know about it. Fear not, Fesitivous Frank is here to the rescue! 

We have created this game on the lines of the ever-classic and nostalgic SuperMario and gave it our own twist by basing it on the theme of Festivus.


Our Protagonist, Frank needs to get home early to celebrate Fesitvus, and he needs your help in order to :
--> collect feast, for the Festivus dinner
--> confront relatives and monster, because airing of the grievances is a must for Festivus(Let them really have it George)
-->Reach home, to see the Fesitvus pole(and yes, it is made of Aluminium).

Controls :
Up arrow --> Move Up
Down---> Move down
Right arrow-->Move right
Left arrow--> Move to the right

We hope you enjoy the game as much as we did making it.
